title: Computer Vision for Anomaly  Detection

description: |
One critical task in video surveillance is
detecting anomalous events such as traffic accidents, crimes
or illegal activities. Generally, anomalous events rarely oc-
cur as compared to normal activities. Therefore, to allevi-
ate the waste of labor and time, developing intelligent com-
puter vision algorithms for automatic video anomaly detec-
tion  is  a  pressing  need.  The  goal  of  a  practical  anomaly
detection system is to timely signal an activity that deviates
normal patterns and identify the time window of the occur-
ring anomaly. Therefore, anomaly detection can be consid-
ered as coarse level video understanding, which filters out
anomalies from normal patterns.

Surveillance cameras are increasingly being used in pub-
lic places: streets, intersections, banks, and shopping malls 
to increase public safety.  However, the monitoring ca-
pability of law enforcement agencies has not kept pace. The
result is that there is a glaring deficiency in the utilization of
surveillance cameras and an unworkable ratio of cameras to
human monitors.  One critical task in video surveillance is
detecting anomalous events such as traffic accidents, crimes
or illegal activities. Generally, anomalous events rarely oc-
cur as compared to normal activities. Therefore, to allevi-
ate the waste of labor and time, developing intelligent com-
puter vision algorithms for automatic video anomaly detec-
tion  is  a  pressing  need.  The  goal  of  a  practical  anomaly
detection system is to timely signal an activity that deviates
normal patterns and identify the time window of the occur-
ring anomaly. Therefore, anomaly detection can be consid-
ered as coarse level video understanding, which filters out
anomalies from normal patterns.  Once an anomaly is de-
tected, it can further be categorized into one of the specific
activities using classification techniques.

Real-world  anomalous  events  are  complicated  and  di-
verse.   It  is  difficult  to  list  all  of  the  possible  anomalous
events.   Therefore,  it is desirable that the anomaly detec-
tion algorithm does not rely on any prior information about
the  events.   In  other  words,  anomaly  detection  should  be
done with minimum supervision.
