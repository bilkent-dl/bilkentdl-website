### Social Media Anomaly Detection

Recent developments in information and detection technologies, and increasing use of intelligent mobile 
devices and Internet have bolstered the capacity and capabilities of data acquisition systens
beyond expectation. Today, many sources of information from shares on social networks to blogs,
from intelligent device activities to security camera recordings are easily accessible. In our project,
we will design state-aware anomaly detection and event prediction systems for social media based on data from diverse sources acquired rapidly
under unstationary conditions and quality using deep learning.
The problem of anomaly (or irregularity) detection and subsequent event prediction is a critical topic of national importance, particularly due to increasing border violations and cyber attacks in
recent years. However, traditional techniques show insufficient performance in real-life applications due to several 
reasons: (1) Data acquired from diverse sources are too large in size to be adequately processed by conventional feature
extraction, signal processing and machine learning methods. (2) The performance of conventional methods is further impaired
by the highly variable properties, structure and quality of text, sound and video data acquired at high speeds.
Therefore, highly innovative approaches are urgently needed to cast the full potential of big data on anomaly detection and
event prediction applications.

In this project, we design novel algorithms that process text on social media and subsequently leverage these data for
context-dependent anomaly detection and event prediction. The main aims of the project area: 1) Design of techniques that will scan text in Turkish on social 
media platforms, and that will extract text features for event detection and prediction; 2) Design of techniques that will
process communication data as well as user information to perform 
anomaly detection and event prediction; 3) Design of deep learning systems that will perform context-dependent processing 
and interpretation of data acquired at various dimensions, times and quality from the rapidly varying nodes and edges;
4) Development of a theoretical foundation for anomaly detection in large-scale social media applications.

We will first study anomaly detection problems over dynamic network structures for social media.
In this regard, detection of context-dependent irregularity is of greater relevance for national security than point 
irregularity. Context-dependent anomaly arises in cases where an event may be considered irregular at certain times and
normal at other instances. As a result, detection of real-life anomalies is compromised due to the time-varying properties
of the information medium, and state, time and context-dependent variations in the anomaly definition. In this project, 
for the first time in literature, we will design optimal anomaly-detection approaches based on content, context and 
location-dependent processing of text, sound and video sequences. The proposed algorithm will select the most informative 
data types and volumes, and the most effective prediction techniques to process the selected data in a state-dependent
manner.
